# Branch-Predictor
Branch prediction is a procedure to reduce the costs of branch instructions. It helps to increase the speed at which the branch instructions are
 processed in the CPU. When a conditional statement is about to be
 executed, the branch predictor guess the outcome of the conditional
 statement. It then processes the instruction ahead of the time. At runtime, if
 the guess is correct, the speed is increased. But if the guess turns out to be
 false, the other branch of the instruction is executed, which leads to delay
 in the circuit. Since the misprediction of the branch instructions leads to a
 delay, we need to improve the accuracy of the branch predictor in order to
 benefit from the branch prediction method
